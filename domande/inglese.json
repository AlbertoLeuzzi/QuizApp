The last thing you should do is take another transatlantic flight.\" With anybody else, I might have argued that I'd slept straight through the New York flight two days ago, and that my next business flight wouldn't be until the twenty-first of January...but with Bridget, I knew, I'd be wasting my breath. Besides, I'd known her long enough to realise this was simply preamble. Bridget never worried about anybody's health except her own. And she never rang me at nine on Monday, suggesting we meet and have lunch, unless she had a reason. Bridget was a one-off, an exceptionally talented writer with a wild imagination that made her books for children instant classic, and a wild nature that drove the poor directors of my literary agency to distraction. In the four years since I'd signed her as a client, Bridget's books had eamed a fortune for the Simon Holland Agency, but her unpredictability had caused much tearing of hair among my colleagues. My favourite of her escapades- the day she'd kicked the BBC presenter- was now a Simon Holland legend. And I, who had survived four years, and one week's holiday in France with Bridget, had risen to the status of a martyr.",
